This project was bootstrapped with the [VertiGIS Studio Workflow SDK](https://github.com/vertigis/vertigis-workflow-sdk). Before you can use your activity pack in the [VertiGIS Studio Workflow Designer](https://apps.vertigisstudio.com/workflow/designer/), you will need to [register the activity pack](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/sdk-web-overview#register-the-activity-pack).

## Available Scripts

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm run generate`

Interactively generate a new activity or form element.

### `npm start`

Runs the project in development mode. Your activity pack will be available at [http://localhost:5000/main.js](http://localhost:5000/main.js). The HTTPS certificate of the development server is a self-signed certificate that web browsers will warn about. To work around this open [`https://localhost:5000/main.js`](https://localhost:5000/main.js) in a web browser and allow the invalid certificate as an exception. For creating a locally-trusted HTTPS certificate see the [Configuring a HTTPS Certificate](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/sdk-web-overview/#configuring-a-https-certificate) section on the [VertiGIS Studio Developer Center](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/overview/).

By default all hosts are allowed. To change this, add one or more `--allowed-hosts` parameters to the command, like so:

```sh
npm start -- --allowed-hosts host1 --allowed-hosts host2
```

NOTE: It is important to include the separate `--` before the list of parameters.

For additional information on how this parameter is used, refer to the webpack-dev-server documentation for [devServer.allowedHosts](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION-v4.md#devserverallowedhosts).

### `npm run build`

Builds the activity pack for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your custom activity pack is now ready to be deployed!

See the [section about deployment](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/sdk-web-overview/#deployment) in the [VertiGIS Studio Developer Center](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/overview/) for more information.
